About me
======
I'm a recently graduated computational physicist with a PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute under professor Vincent Meunier. My areas of interest are scientific programming with a focus on computational physics and software development, where my programming background includes C++, MPI, Rust, TypeScript, and Python. My physics background covers theoretical Raman spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, specifically relating to graphene and carbon-based nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons. I'm also interested in machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, and have done some work in that field (currently unpublished). See my CV for more information.
