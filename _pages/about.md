About me
======
I'm a recently graduated computational physicist with a PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Instutute under professor Vincent Meunier. My areas of interest are scientific programming with a focus on computational physics, where my programming background includes C++, MPI, Rust, Python, and working on Linux-based large scale computing platforms. My physics background covers theoretical Raman spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, specifically relating to graphene and carbon-based nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons. I'm also interested in machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, and have done some work in that field (currently unpublished). See my CV for more information.
