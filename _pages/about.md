About me
======
I'm a current Physics graduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Instutute in professor Vincent Meunier's research group with an expected graduation of December 2019. My areas of interest are computational physics with a focus on scientific programming, where my programming background includes C++, MPI, Rust, and working on Linux-based large scale computing platforms. My physics background covers theoretical Raman spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, specifically relating to graphene and carbon-based nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons.
