About me
======
I'm a computational physicist and software developer with over 6 years of experience in scientific programming and analysis. Applications I've developed have clarified properties and behaviors of nanomaterials, ran on top supercomputing systems, and, in collaboration with research groups worldwide, resulted in more than 10 publications. My programming background includes C++, MPI, Rust, TypeScript, and Python. My physics background covers theoretical Raman spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, specifically relating to graphene and carbon-based nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons. I'm also interested in machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, and have done some work in that field. See my CV for more information.
