About me
======
I'm a computational physicist and software developer with 6 years of experience in scientific programming and analysis. As a researcher I solve challenging problems in condensed matter physics, have collaborated with research groups worldwide, and have over 10 publications, including in top journals such as Nature and ACS Nano. As a developer I have experience developing for heterogeneous and supercomputing systems, writing both clear and high-performance code, and designing novel algorithms for scientific applications. 

My programming background includes C++, Rust, TypeScript, and Python. My physics background covers theoretical Raman spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, specifically relating to graphene and carbon-based nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons. I'm also interested in machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, and have done some work in that field. See my CV or my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-r-daniels/) for more information about my employment history/to contact me, my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3512-7146) for a current list of publications, and my [GitHub page](https://github.com/colin-daniels) for a portion of the software development that I've done.
